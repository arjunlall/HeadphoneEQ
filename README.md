Equalization files for EqualizerAPO

What is it?
HeadphoneEQ is a set of digital signal processing (DSP) filters that allow headphones to emulate listening to well tuned near field studio monitor speakers. Music sounds like it is coming from speakers in front of you instead of headphones. The virtual speakers are modeled after measurements of the JBL M2 Reference Monitors and provide authoritative clean bass, well balanced midrange and a revealing high end. explain target curve



HeadphoneEQ works on top of EqualizerAPO, a piece of windows software that allows low level access to system audio.

Since each pair of headphones sound different there are two parts to the equalization process. One to balance each set of headphones to a flat baseline and another to emulate the target curve
