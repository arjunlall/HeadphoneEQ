# HeadphoneEQ
Virtualized audiophile grade studio monitors built on EqualizerAPO

What is it?
HeadphoneEQ is a set of digital signal processing (DSP) filters that allow headphones to emulate listening to well tuned near field studio monitor speakers. Put simply, music sounds like it is coming from audiophile grade speakers in front of you instead of your headphones. The virtual speakers are modeled after measurements of the JBL M2 Reference Monitors and provide authoritative clean bass, well balanced midrange and a revealing high end. The EQ curve has two parts, first to equalize the differences between different headphones and second to adjust the response to match both measurements of the JBL M2 Reference Monitors and the Harman Target Response curve.

HeadphoneEQ works on top of EqualizerAPO, a piece of windows software that allows low level access to system audio.
